This repo contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms including back propagation with stochastic gradient descent and the perceptron algorithm. These algorithms were written using only the numpy library and are therefore good demonstrations of how the algorithms actually work. 

This repo contains the following algorithms: 
(a) perceptron classifier 
(b) single layer neural network with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss trained with stochastic back propagation.
